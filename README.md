# Automation demo project
Automation example project using Robot Framework + Selenium on Java. Blogger website was used for demonstration.

This is a very simple project that only tests the Blogger home page by checking that all elements exist and can be interacted with. It's used as a demonstration for the tutorial I published <a href="https://github.com/patr1c1a/QA-articles/blob/master/Step%20by%20step%20project%20with%20Robot%20Framework%2BSelenium.pdf">here</a> and it's not being mantained.
