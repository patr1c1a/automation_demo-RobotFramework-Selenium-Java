# robotFramework-bloggerWebsite-
Automation example project using Robot Framework + Selenium on Java. Blogger website was used for demonstration.

This is a very simple project that only tests the home page of the website by checking all elements exist and can be interacted with. It's used as a demonstration for the tutorial I published <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/create-project-using-eclipsemavenseleniumrobot-framework-miguel/">here</a> and it's not being updated.
